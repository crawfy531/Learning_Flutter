# Overview

In my exploration of learning flutter, I showed my progress of learning this language through creating a simple hide and seek program. This program is a single screen program that
can be run on a mobile device. The way this program works is that it displays the name of the game, simple instructions, a grid of Os with one X, and four buttons with
movement directions written on them. The player is the X, in order to move the player the user much press one of the buttons to move the player in the specified 
direction. If the player is directed to move outside of the grid, the player will be moved to the opposite side of the grid. As the player is moving, the user wants
to find the place in the grid where the directions will say that they have won and that they have found the treasure. The treasure is in a random generated position 
on the grid and has no specifications showing where it is. To make this program I learned some helpful things about flutter like what stateful widgets are and how
to make theme data. This is the first mobile app that I have ever programmed and I found that learning how to program this app has helped me broaden my understanding
of some of the different uses for code.

# Future Work

* make a home page that will start the game when the user presses a button
* implement a villain that starts and moves in random directions, if the player collides with the villain then it is game over
* implement a more desirable looking playing board that is more than just showing lists
