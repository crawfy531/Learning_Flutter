# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

In my exploration of learning flutter, I showed my progress of learning this language through creating a simple hide and seek program. This program is a single screen program that
can be run on a mobile device. The way this program works is there is 

{Provide a description of your app. Describe how to use the app.}

{Describe your purpose for creating this app.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

* Android Studio
* Flutter
* Dart

# Useful Websites

* [official flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
* [The Net Ninja Flutter tutorial (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ukSR1GRtMU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ)

# Future Work

* make a home page that will start the game when the user presses a button
* implement a villain that starts and moves in random directions, if the player collides with the villain then it is game over
* implement a more desirable looking playing board that is more than just showing lists
